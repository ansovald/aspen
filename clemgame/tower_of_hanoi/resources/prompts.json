Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty peg.\n3. No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n\nThe pegs are named $peg_names.\n\nThe game starts with all disks stacked in ascending order of size on the first peg, with the smallest disk at the top.\n\nHere is the initial configuration of the game:\n\n```\n$initial_board\n```\n\nYou can make your moves by specifying the source peg and the destination peg. For example, to move a disk from $source_peg to $destination_peg, you would say: '[$source_peg $destination_peg]'\n\n",
